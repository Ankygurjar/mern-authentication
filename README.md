# mern-authentication
This project illustrates how to make authentication functionalities using MERN(Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS). 

MERN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MERN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments
